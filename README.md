**Abstract:** 
Effective visualizations of document collections provide comprehensive summaries
of each document’s content. An approach of this kind of visualization is introduced
by Stobel et al. in their work [Document Cards: A Top Trumps Visualization for
Documents](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38015441_Document_Cards_A_Top_Trumps_Visualization_for_Documents). 
This thesis provides an adapted visualization technique
based on their work. The adapted Document Cards display extracted key terms and
the most important images for each document in a grid-like arrangement, which
represents the entire document collection. Extraction methods are carried out using
the semantic structure of a document. Key Terms are weighted by their frequency
of occurrence in each paragraph. The image captions are used for the image
weighting. Additionally, images are classified by analyzing their color distribution
to pick images of each class for a representative visualization. The interactive
interface is implemented with Python’s Panel tool. Furthermore, the
effectiveness and the limitations of the adapted approach will be explored. With the
adapted Document Cards, the users get a visualization technique that meets the key
points of Shneiderman’s Visual Information Seeking Mantra, but can be
further enhanced in the future by combining different types of document collection
visualization techniques.
